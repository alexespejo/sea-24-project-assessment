## My Passion For Music

Music has always been a big part of my life, from playing drum kit in middle school to conducting my high school marching band.

However, recently, listening to music has become a hobby for me. Enjoy listening to new artists and exploring different genres. I especially enjoy going back to albums like these that have revolutionized their respective genres and studying the immense influence they've had on many artists I listen to today.
